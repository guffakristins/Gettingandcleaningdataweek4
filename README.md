#Getting and Cleaning Data - week 4 

This is the peer-reviewed project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. Here is a short description on what [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/guffakristins/Gettingandcleaningdataweek4/blob/master/run_analysis.R) does:

* Download and unzip the file.
* Loads "activity labels" and "features".
* Extracts the needed mean and standard deviation.
* Loads "train" and "test" datasets.
* Merges the two datasets.
* Converts the activity and subject columns into factors.
* Creates a tidy dataset.
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
